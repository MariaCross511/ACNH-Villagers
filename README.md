# ACNH-Villagers
In the Nintendo switch game, Animal Crossing New Horizons (ACNH), there are nearly 400 villagers that might move to your island and become on of your 10 new neighbors. With so many critters to pick from, it can be hard to compare them to one another and make a decision about who your dream team is. Some villagers get along better than others, and some may match the theme of your island better than others. Use this app to compare villagers to one another or obtain a nice write-up of your 10 villagers to screencap and keep with you!

To access my app, visit:
Or use code:

**Instructions for use**
The app is quite simple really. You may either scroll through the list of villager names and select the ones you'd like to compare, or more practically just type the name of each villager one at a time and select their name when you see it. Once you are finished selecting the villagers you'd like to compare, click "Display" and a chart will appear on the right comparing your selected villagers. 

Unrelated note: If you're seeing this in the ACNH Discord Server, message me (@marla.marnina.martia)! I'd love to visit your island, meet your villagers, trade items, etc.
